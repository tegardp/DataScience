This is my analysis about Wine Quality. 

#### About The Data
* Data are collected on 12 different properties of the wines one of which is Quality, based on sensory data, and the rest are on chemical properties of the wines including density, acidity, alcohol content etc.
* All chemical properties of wines are continuous variables.
* Quality is an ordinal variable with possible ranking from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
* Each variety of wine is tasted by three independent tasters and the final rank assigned is the median rank given by the tasters.
