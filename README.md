# Data science portfolio by Tegar Dani Pratama

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Production Level Project

### Chatbot

A conversational chatbot in which was created for Badan Pusat Statistik. The main functionality of the bot is to distinguish questions (questions related to what kind of data customers want) and then either give an answer or talk using a conversational model.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews:
Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis. The reviews classified into score of 1 - 5. With 1 being very negative and 5 very positive.

### Real or Not With Disaser Tweets:
Classify tweets about disaster is real or not. Using simple logistic regression the model can achieve 81% accuracy.

### Spam Comment Classification:
Classify comments into spam or not spam
[notebook](https://github.com/tegardp/data-science/blob/master/Portfolio/20191210%20Spam%20Comment%20Classification/Comment%20Classification.ipynb)

### News Title Classification:
Classify News title into four categories: Business, Entertainment, Technology, and Medical
